##### Smart Expense Tracking for Smart Business Owners


## ðŸ“Œ App Overview
Smart Daily Expense Tracker is a full-featured module built for small business owners to easily record, analyze, and manage their daily expenses.  
It provides a clean and simple UI with screens for **Expense Entry**, **Expense List**, and **Expense Reports**, helping users digitize expense records instead of losing them on paper or chat apps.

## ðŸ¤– AI Usage Summary
Throughout the development, I used **AI tools (ChatGPT, Copilot, Cursor)** to accelerate the workflow.  
AI helped me in:
- Generating Jetpack Compose UI layouts and optimizing state management with `ViewModel + StateFlow`.  
- Structuring the MVVM architecture and writing boilerplate ViewModel/Repository code faster.  
- Prompting for UX/UI enhancements like empty states, validations, and animations.  
- Creating clear documentation (this README) and refining code comments.  

AI was not just supportive but **actively co-pilot in design + implementation decisions**.

## ðŸ’¬ Prompt Logs
Here are some of the **key prompts I used** (unedited / raw) while building the project:

- "give me a clean MVVM structure for expense tracker in jetpack compose with stateflow and repository"  
- "how to show total spent today at the top of screen in realtime jetpack compose"  
- "jetpack compose expense entry screen with title, amount, category dropdown, notes, image upload and submit button"  
- "add animation when expense is added and show toast message"  
- "how to implement expense list screen grouped by category or time with toggle button"  
- "can you show me mocked report screen with bar chart for last 7 days in compose"  
- "simulate pdf or csv export and trigger share intent compose"  
- "give me idea for theme switcher dark and light mode in jetpack compose"  
- "how to add validation like amount > 0 and title should not be empty in viewmodel"  
- "mock duplicate detection when adding same expense again"  
- "navigation setup between 3 screens in jetpack compose cleanest way"  
- "write code comments for better readability"  
- "help me write impactful readme file for smart daily expense tracker module"
